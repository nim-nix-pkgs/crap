> `rm` files without fear

### Why?
Ever `rm`ed a file and instantly regretted it? Fear not, for `crap` is here. 

### How?
`crap` follows the FreeDesktop.org Trash spec. So instead of perma-deleting your file, `crap` moves it to the `$XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash` folder. If this environment variable isn't set, it defaults to `~/.local/share/Trash`.

And obviously, ***this works only on Linux***. 

## Installation
```console
$ nimble install crap
```

or download the binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/icyphox/crap/releases/) page.

### Tip
Alias `crap` to `rm` in your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`. But that's kinda the point.

## Usage
```console
$ crap foo.png

$ crap *.png

$ crap a.pdf b.jpg c.mp4

```
Aaannddd it'll show up in your file manager's Trash.
